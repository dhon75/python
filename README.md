# python
My python repository.

Python hobbyist looking for ideas, opportunities, and inspiration...

Past python projects include:<br>
Logging function (we all need a logger)<br>
HTML file writers<br>
.csv file writers<br>
File archiver<br>
A Mesh file type converter<br>
An Autonomous emailer<br>
File Index Writing and Searching (Server searching done in milliseconds)<br>
File Manager<br>
  
  
Along with Python, I have hobbyist interests in BASH, Powershell, & Blender.

This is first GitHub repository.  I LOVE TO CODE and looking for inspiration / direction.
