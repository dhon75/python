# python
My python repository.

Python hobbyist looking for ideas, opportunities, and inspiration...

Past python projects include: 
  Logging function (we all need a logger)
  HTML file writers
  .csv file writers
  File archiver
  A Mesh file type converter
  An Autonomous emailer
  File Index Writing and Searching (Server searching done in milliseconds)
  File Manager
  
  
Along with Python, I have hobbyist interests in BASH, Powershell, & Blender.

This is first GitHub repository.  I LOVE TO CODE and looking for inspiration / direction.
